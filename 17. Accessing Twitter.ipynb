There's a lot of interesting information in a tweet, so feel free to experiment with it. Note that we'll store the tweet location as present on the user's profile, which might not correspond to the current or real location of the user sending the tweet.

    "The next thing to do is instantiate an object of the MyStreamer class with our credentials passed as arguments, and we'll use the filter method to only collect tweets we're interested in. We'll create our filter with the track argument which provides the filter keywords, in our case \"python\". Besides the track argument, there are more possibilities to fine-tune your filter, listed in the [basic streaming parameters](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/guides/basic-stream-parameters), such as: collecting tweets from selected users, languages, locations etc. The paid versions of the Streaming API would provide much more filtering options."
